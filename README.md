# Mountain Finder iOS App
This is meant to be a companion app to the [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) website and mobile app. All data is being pulled from the Mountain Project [API](https://www.mountainproject.com/data). This app is different as it allows you to find the climbs closest to you and allow you to filter by type of climb.

## Setup
You will need your own API key to get this code to run. First signup or login for an account [here](https://www.mountainproject.com/). Then your private key can be found [here](https://www.mountainproject.com/data).  
To get this code running you will need to set one global variable somewhere in the code:
```
let apiKey = "YOUR_OWN_API_KEY"
```
